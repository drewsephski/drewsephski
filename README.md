## Featured Project

### Nodebase
**AI-powered backend & workflow foundation for modern applications**

Nodebase is my core project — a modular Node.js platform designed to accelerate backend development, automation, and AI integration.

**Focus areas**
- API-first architecture
- AI-assisted workflows
- Background jobs & automation
- Scalable Node.js patterns
- Clean abstractions over infrastructure

> Built to reduce boilerplate, not flexibility.
